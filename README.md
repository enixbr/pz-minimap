# pixel-minimap

## Keys:

Q...G: Select color

space: Hide / show.  We start up with minimap hidden.

+/-: Zoom the minimap

x: For each press, hide more ui elements temporarily

The number beside user count is seconds the user count stayed the same. It helps a little bit to detect if you get disconnected.
